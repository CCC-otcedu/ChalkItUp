# ChalkItUp

This is a turned in for a CIS-131 assignment titled Chalk It Up, on 11-15-21

Note: I made sure that the code for my assignment was correct, although the app I use to program for this class, Atom.io, had issues when I tried to load up npms instead of Visual Studio, which the concept videos used. 
Even discussing in the group chat, we weren't sure why it wouldn't load them, though I have made an effort to ensure the code itself was correct before submission.
Just the one thing was not working on my end.
A .gitignore init file is used to ignore the node_module folder and was uploaded with the package.json and index.js files in the Chalk it up folder, but GitHub says that the file is hidden from view
